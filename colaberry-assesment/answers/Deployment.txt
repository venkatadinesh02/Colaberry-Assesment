Deployment
Q. Assume you are asked to get your code running in the cloud using AWS. What tools and AWS services would you use to deploy the API, database, and a scheduled version of your data ingestion code? Write up a description of your approach ?

1. API Deployment
Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to host the Flask API with auto-scaling and load balancing.
Set up a custom domain via Amazon Route 53 and enable HTTPS using AWS Certificate Manager.
2. Database Deployment
Host the PostgreSQL database on Amazon RDS with multi-AZ for high availability and automated backups.
Secure RDS access with a VPC security group and restrict connections to Elastic Beanstalk instances.
3. Scheduled Data Ingestion
Use AWS Lambda for running ingestion jobs.
Apache-Airflow will be one of the solution i would like for scheduled ingestion
